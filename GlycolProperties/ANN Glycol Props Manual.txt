****Instructions for using neural network based glycol property routines in MATLAB****

1. Add the property library files (EG_Cp, PG_Cp etc: total 8 script files) in your working folder or MATLAB path

2. The property routines are based on EES property reference data so they will agree well with EES models

3. The units of input and output are:
	
	Temeprature - K
	Concentration - %
	Specific Heat - kJ/kg-K
	Thermal Conductivity: W/m-K
	Density: kg/m^3
	Dynamic Viscosity: kg/m-s
	

4. The property routines are called by using the function and three property inputs as a vector input in its transpose form. Sample command is:
	Cp=EG_Cp([T,C]');
   Note: Matrix containing multiple property input sets can be provided for calculations.

Range of applicability: 

EG: Temperature (-30,50) deg. C, Concentration: (0,50) %
PG: Temperature (-30,50) deg. C, Concentration: (0,50) %
